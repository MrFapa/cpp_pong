This clone was made by me to learn the basics of OpenGL and further improve my C++ skills.

It is not designed to have incredible performance, be super short or designed very smart.

The whole purpose was to test basic features of the used technologies.

* customizable game settings (window size, paddle size/speed, puck angle, speed, etc

## This project does NOT include

* proper display of settings (some sort of menu)
* CMake / Premake file
